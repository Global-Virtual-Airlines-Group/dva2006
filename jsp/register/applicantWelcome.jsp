<br />
${applicant.firstName}, on behalf of <content:airline /> welcome to our virtual aviation community! 
We're delighted that you are interested in joining one of the oldest, largest and most successful 
virtual airlines on the Internet.<br />
<br />
Unlike most virtual airlines that track seniority simply by hours flown or transferred from other
virtual airlines, <content:airline /> grants promotions and type ratings based on pilot knowledge 
and skill handling his or her aircraft. Because of our philosophy, <span class="bld">you will be
placed in the aircraft stage on program that best matches your skills</span>.<br />
<br />
To help us determine this, you'll be asked to take a short <fmt:int value="${questionnaire.size}" />-question 
questionnaire. It should take just a few minutes to complete, and based upon the results we will 
be able to place you in the right program for you.<br />
<br />
In order to complete the membership process at <content:airline />, we must have a valid e-mail 
address on file for you. An e-mail message has been sent to you with a URL to click to validate 
your e-mail address. <span class="error bld">It is critical that your e-mail provider is able to 
receive e-mail messages from the domain <i>${ourDomain}</i> without any filtering. If you do not 
respond to the automated e-mail verification message, your application to <content:airline /> 
cannot be approved!</span><br />
